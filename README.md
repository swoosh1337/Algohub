#Algohub
Algohub is the ultimate algorithm analysis and sharing platform. It serves as a centralized hub where users can upload algorithms, explore algorithms uploaded by others in different programming languages, and benchmark them on various machines. Think of it as a Wikipedia for algorithms. This project was developed as the final project for a software engineering class.

## Technologies Used
Java
React
AWS (RDS, S3, API Gateway, Lambda functions)

## Features
Algorithm Upload: Users can upload their algorithms to the platform, allowing them to share their solutions and contribute to the algorithmic knowledgebase.

Algorithm Exploration: Users can explore algorithms uploaded by others, categorized by programming language. This allows for learning from different implementations and approaches.

Benchmarking: The platform enables benchmarking algorithms on different machines, allowing users to compare the performance of various implementations.

## Installation
To run the Algohub project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
Install the required dependencies for the Java backend.
Set up the necessary AWS services (RDS, S3, API Gateway, Lambda functions) and configure the project to connect to them.
Install the required dependencies for the React frontend.
Configure the frontend to connect to the backend APIs.
Start the backend server.
Start the frontend development server.
